# Dino Facts

This application allows you to enter your data (name, weight, height and diet) through a form and then compare you against different species of Dinosours. It shows amazing facts about them too in the form of 9 tiles with your name at the center.

## Key learnings

* Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript 

This application uses Object Oriented JavaScript. I used a class "Dino" as a blueprint for all the dinosour species and generated object corresponding to each of them. There are some object methods which compared your data with the dino data. Then at the end the data from these objects are used to dynamically update the UI with tiles containing species name, imag and a random fact about the specific dinosour.
